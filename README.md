*What does the project do?* 
The user starts a multiple choice quiz after clicking the start button. There is a timer displayed for each question (30seconds) along with the question and the multiple choices. If the user clicks on the choices or runs out of time, then the screen repopulates with a gif associated with the question. There is also text displaying whether the answer was correct or shows the correct answer if the wrong answer was chose. At the end of the game, the user can see how many questions were correct, wrong or unanswered. A restart game button is available to restart the game without refreshing the page.

*Why the project is useful?*
Taught how to use setInterval and more onclick event listeners. It was also interesting to use the array of objects for the multiple choice questions to refactor the code.
